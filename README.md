- 👩🏻‍💻 About me ...

The last few months I have been training in #Python #SQL #MySQL #Anaconda #Numpy #Tableau doing projects in #PairProgramming and in teams under the #Scrum framework and #Agile philosophy.

My curiosity to want to understand the data from its origin has led me to specialize in its extraction, analysis, transformation and visualization. I have more than 10 years of experience developing business strategies in Commerce Marketing, all our decisions were based on data. I know their value and importance and the impact they can have on the business, and now I know how to explore and manage them from programming. I am excited about the idea of ​​being able to contribute all this value to the Technology Sector, which is where I want to continue my professional career.

I have experience at a national level with leading international companies in their sector, which is why I speak fluent English and business English, the people who work with me usually point out that I have great communication skills and understanding of objectives, which has always helped me maintain focus on my management of teams, projects and results. It was a year ago when technology crossed paths in my career and since then it was clear to me to make the leap to the technology sector, specializing as a Data Analyst.
