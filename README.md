The last few months I have been training to transform my profile in DATA ANALYST in #Python #SQL #MySQL #Anaconda #Numpy #Tableau carrying out projects in #PairProgramming and in teams under the #Scrum framework and #Agile philosophy.

My interest in exploring data from core has led me to specialize in its extraction, analysis, transformation and visualization. I have more than 10 years of experience in Retail marketing strategies, all business decisions were based on data analysis, so I really know f its relevancy. Actually I continue managing Data from programming perspective. I am completely sure technology is an essential tool in business development

I have experience at a national level with leading international companies in their sector, which is why I speak fluent English and business English, the people who work with me usually point out that I have great communication skills and understanding of objectives, which has always help maintain focus on my management of teams, projects and results. It was a year ago when technology crossed paths in my career and since then it was clear to me to make the leap to the technology sector, specializing as a Data Analyst.
